# Installation and First Use

This guide covers **v2.5.0 stable**. Download the [complete installation ZIP](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/releases/download/v2.5.0/zy-cinematic-realism-v2.5.0.zip) ([SHA-256 checksum](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/releases/download/v2.5.0/zy-cinematic-realism-v2.5.0.zip.sha256)), or install the [main-branch source](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/tree/main/zy-cinematic-realism). See the [v2.5.0 Release](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/releases/tag/v2.5.0) for version notes.

## Install in Codex

According to the current OpenAI documentation, Codex discovers Skills in the user-level `$HOME/.agents/skills` and project-level `.agents/skills` directories. You can also ask the built-in `$skill-installer` to install from another GitHub repository. See [OpenAI: Build skills](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

### Method 1: Ask Codex to install from GitHub

Enter this in Codex:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install zy-cinematic-realism from this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism
Use the main branch and the skill folder zy-cinematic-realism.
```

If your Codex interface offers a Skills installation or local import entry point, you can also choose the ZIP from the latest Release or the extracted `zy-cinematic-realism` folder. Entry points vary by product interface.

### Method 2: Install manually

Extract the [v2.5.0 installation ZIP](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/releases/download/v2.5.0/zy-cinematic-realism-v2.5.0.zip), or download the [main-branch source](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/tree/main), then copy the complete `zy-cinematic-realism` folder into your user-level Skills directory.

**Windows**

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\zy-cinematic-realism
```

**macOS / Linux**

```text
$HOME/.agents/skills/zy-cinematic-realism
```

You can also install it for one project only:

```text
your-project/.agents/skills/zy-cinematic-realism
```

Codex normally discovers the change automatically. Restart Codex if the Skill does not appear. After installation, enter:

```text
Use $zy-cinematic-realism to turn “two detectives riding a night bus back to the station
after a failed interrogation” into a grounded cinematic still prompt.
```

## Use in ChatGPT

### If your account has a Skills installation entry point

According to the current OpenAI documentation, Personal Skills are generally available to ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, Healthcare, and Edu users, subject to workspace settings and permissions. Do not assume the feature is enabled for every ChatGPT account. See [OpenAI: Skills in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001066).

If Skills are available in your account or workspace:

1. Open **Plugins** in the sidebar.
2. Open **Skills** in the Plugin Directory.
3. Choose **Create**, then **Upload from your computer**.
4. Download and upload the [complete v2.5.0 package](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/releases/download/v2.5.0/zy-cinematic-realism-v2.5.0.zip), named `zy-cinematic-realism-v2.5.0.zip`.
5. After scanning and installation finish, enter `$zy-cinematic-realism` or describe a cinematic prompt task directly.

Personal Skills currently need to be added separately in desktop and web/mobile interfaces; they do not automatically synchronize across those interfaces.

### If your account does not have a Skills entry point

Paste the full [self-contained chat starter](chat-starter-en.md) into an AI conversation that can read text and, when needed, images. Add your idea or references. It includes basic scene creation, reference roles, medium preservation, and scoped repair without requiring repository access.

This basic edition does not contain all 38 directors, creative cards, or model parameter adapters. Full capability requires the complete installed folder or access to the relevant references. **Pasting SKILL.md alone is not a complete installation.**

### Check the installation

```text
Use $zy-cinematic-realism:
A woman just off work holds hot coffee with both hands inside a rainy-night convenience store, looking away from camera.
Give me a Midjourney prompt and briefly explain the key visual decisions.
```

Expect a scene-specific prompt without another model question. If the Skill is missing, check for an accidentally nested duplicate folder. Replace the complete old folder when upgrading; avoid duplicate installations.

### Start with a story or screenplay

Attach the story or screenplay excerpt you want to develop, then describe the task naturally:

```text
Use $zy-cinematic-realism:
I have a short story. Develop a scene art concept to discuss with the director.
Propose candidate spaces, materials, character looks, props, and light.
Separate source facts, story interpretation, and new design proposals.
Start with a model-neutral plan.
Here is the excerpt:
(Paste the passage you want to develop here.)
```

Art concepts help a director discuss the visual world; spaces, materials, character looks, props, and light remain candidate designs. To see a change in the story, you can directly ask “Choose key frames where the relationship changes.” Each frame shows one specific moment, without requiring an art-concept pass first. The Skill follows the current request; one sentence is enough to start.

The Skill reads the characters' goals, resistance, and change from accessible text. Designs absent from the passage are identified as proposals. For an analysis-only pass, say “Analyze first; no prompt yet” and receive analysis only.

An art concept or frame plan is not the final prompt. When you need one, ask “Compile this art concept for Midjourney,” or “Keep the accepted visual decisions and compile the selected frame.” If the initial request already asks for a prompt, the Skill compiles it directly. It keeps the established model; you can also request a model-neutral prompt first. It does not generate images automatically; actual generation needs the image features in your environment.

For a full script, name the scenes you want to develop. A movie title still needs a readable excerpt or source. Film memory, subtitles, and film stills do not replace screenplay evidence.

The [Titanic third-class dance example](titanic-story-to-frame.md) shows script actions becoming original visual development: the P01 direction and new P02/P03 images confirmed usable by the user. These are original development images, not film stills.

[The Last Photo art-concept and key-frame trial](last-photo-art-development.md) includes three images confirmed usable by the user: the empty-chair invitation, shoulder lean with a small smile, and empty-room art concept. They show the different purposes of relationship key frames and scene design.

### Resume in a new conversation

Supply the full Decode Card or Project Handoff Card again. Reattach accessible images when identity depends on them; text cards do not replace visual identity references. The Skill does not automatically save projects or synchronize cards between conversations.

This card is optional; one sentence is enough to start.
