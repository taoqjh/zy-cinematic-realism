# Changelog

## v2.5.0 — 2026-10-04

### Added

- Story to Frame workflow for developing a readable screenplay excerpt or story passage through character change, a visual world, and key frames.
- Explicit separation of source facts, story interpretation, and new visual proposals, with source availability and provenance recorded.
- Scene art concepts for director discussion, covering candidate spaces, materials, character looks, props, and light, distinguished from narrative key frames that show one specific moment of relationship change.
- Frame selection preserves action order and location while choosing one visible moment per image; shared world decisions feed the existing Scene Master and Continuity Bible.
- Titanic scenes 85 and 87 worked example connecting script reading, visual proposals, reference decoding, external Image2 generation, and inspection; it displays the P01 direction and replacement P02/P03 images confirmed usable on 2026-10-04, while preserving earlier failed results separately.
- The Last Photo qualitative trial preserves the initial art concept and adds three follow-up external images accepted for case display: the empty-chair invitation, shoulder lean with a small smile, and an empty-room art concept (2026-10-04).

### Improved

- Chinese and English README and first-use docs introduce screenplay work through natural-language requests, with a short text entry linking the full case.
- Self-contained chat starters include basic script reading, visual development, and one-moment frame selection without external reference-file dependencies.
- Analysis-only requests, accepted visual directions, and model-native compilation remain scoped to the user's request.
- Story entry follows the requested purpose without a mandatory two-option menu, additional image set, or model questionnaire. Art concepts and frame plans require prompt compilation before generation; the Skill does not generate images automatically.

### Validation and Release Status

- docs/validation-v2.5.md records static checks and independent text behavior separately. The old/new text runs and their additional length compression are preserved in docs/titanic-comparison-v2.5.md.
- The planned six-image comparison was not completed. Later reference-driven external revisions are not controlled A/B evidence; no overall winner or general image-quality improvement is established.
- The user recognizes P01 as the visual direction for later work; this does not accept the complete series or Bible. Earlier P02/P03 results failed visual review; after an external Image2 revision on 2026-10-04, the user confirmed both replacement images usable. This does not certify every action or costume detail.
- The Last Photo trial is qualitative, has no controlled comparison, and does not lock a specific set or face; it establishes no general image-quality improvement.
- Stable release: [v2.5.0](https://github.com/popopo-99/zy-cinematic-realism/releases/tag/v2.5.0), with the complete installation ZIP and SHA-256 checksum. Installation instructions use the main branch or the versioned Release package.

## v2.4.0 — 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Director strength now respects subtle / clear / strong requests; unspecified strength uses clear instead of coercing every request to iconic.
- User-locked action, viewpoint, framing, sources, and composition are excluded from differentiation quotas. Strong interpretation uses only available compatible open decisions.
- Four-axis director planning no longer forces a labeled five-line block into every native or prompt-only result; target adapters control final syntax.
- Installation docs no longer equate pasting SKILL.md with providing its complete reference library.

### Added

- Opt-in Project Handoff Card and restore workflow for cumulative accepted state, reference availability, image status, and the next permitted change.
- Chinese and English self-contained basic chat starters without external reference-file dependencies; their reduced scope is explicit.
- A reference-grounded Dream Decode text example with a complete portable card, new-scene prompt, and explicit not-generated status.
- Manual behavior cases 61–72 for strength, locks, native output, cumulative handoff, unavailable inputs, mood preservation, and accepted edits.
- Reproducible ZIP builder and lossless PNG-to-WebP presentation conversion with pixel equality checks.

### Improved

- Chinese and English README lead with first use and creator tasks, with long tutorials, authored galleries, credits, model comparisons, and unchanged licensing text linked from focused pages.
- Ordinary creation can expose a few concise visual decisions; prompt-only and analysis-only output remain scoped. Detailed plans and handoff are requested as needed.
- Cinematic defaults and cleanup preserve explicit joy, daylight, celebration, or climax instead of implying darkness or aftermath is mandatory.

### Validation and Compatibility

- Independent text behavior checks and static/package validation are recorded separately in docs/validation-v2.4.md. Image comparisons and human usability gains remain unvalidated.
- Technical name, invocation, 38 director files, four model adapters, legacy handling, original showcase images, attribution, and CC BY-NC 4.0 remain intact.
- Intentional behavior change: unspecified director strength is now clear. Use strong / iconic explicitly to request the previous strong interpretation, subject to user locks.

## v2.3.0 — 2026-09-27

### Added

- Medium-aware Dream Decode with per-reference role isolation and explicit `Host Medium + Secondary Construction Rule` for user-requested cross-medium work.
- Optional Expression Mechanism and reusable Decode Card fields that preserve the transferable relationship without copying source content.
- `USER-LOCKED` / `OPEN` Scene Master visual decisions and three-to-five Active Core Rules selected from the full five-to-eight-rule archive.
- Image-level manual regression protocol using at least three paired comparisons per case, plus a general Skill validator.

### Improved

- Compiler Priority Gate preserves reference medium and scene intent while selecting only relevant visual grammar for each native model prompt.
- Decode Repair distinguishes Valid Adaptation from Medium Drift and Mechanism Drift; GPT Image compilation protects non-photographic media from default camera/capture language.
- Kept the technical name, four independent model adapters, earlier workflows, and CC BY-NC 4.0 license unchanged.

## v2.2.0 — 2026-09-24

### Added

- Dream Decode / 解梦 for explaining why reference images look the way they do and extracting transferable visual rules.
- Reference Role Router with explicit user-role priority and conservative role inference.
- Separation of reference Scene Facts, transferable Visual Grammar, and context-dependent Hybrid Decisions.
- Five-to-eight executable Core Visual Rules as the main decoded input to transfer and compilation.
- Dynamic Transfer Scope with Strong Transfer, Conditional Transfer, and Do Not Transfer boundaries.
- Decode Transfer from reference-derived visual grammar into a new Scene Master without prompt-to-prompt noun replacement.
- Multi-Reference Consensus Decode for stable shared rules and Variable Traits.
- Role-Based Multi-Reference Decode for separately assigned color, composition, identity, material, and other responsibilities.
- Decode Card schema with Core Visual Rules / 核心梦律, explicit Transfer Scope, Allowed Variation, Source Residue, and Drift Warnings, without automatic persistence claims.
- Decode Repair classification for Valid Adaptation versus Actual Drift before surgical correction.
- Eighteen Dream Decode regression cases covering analysis, transfer, multi-reference routing, conflicts, cards, valid adaptation, terminology, compression, compilation, repair, and scene contamination.

### Changed

- Scene Master can now receive visual grammar extracted from reference images without treating reference content as scene facts.
- Prompt Compiler prioritizes Scene Master, five-to-eight Core Visual Rules, Transfer Scope, and only relevant supporting Visual Grammar instead of copying the complete Decode Card.
- Reference handling now resolves explicit roles before analysis, transfer, or adapter mapping.
- GPT Image 2.5, Midjourney V8.2, Seedream 5.0 Pro, and Nano Banana adapters can compile the same `Scene Master + Decoded Visual Grammar` through their own native prompt shapes.
- Result Repair can compare an accepted Reference Decode with a generated result and preserve successful variables.
- Continuity can use a Decode Card for shared visual grammar while the Continuity Bible remains responsible for series facts and state.
- Chinese and English README files now introduce Dream Decode through “understand, learn, use” rather than a feature dump.

### Preserved

- Scene Master remains the canonical source of scene facts.
- Model Compiler architecture and independent target-specific compilation remain unchanged.
- Existing Director, Style, Cinematography, Prompt Check, Transcode, Remix, Creative Shuffle, Result Repair, and Continuity systems remain compatible.
- GPT Image 2.5, Midjourney V8.2, Seedream 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana, and legacy target handling remain supported.
- Technical skill name `zy-cinematic-realism`, folder name, and `$zy-cinematic-realism` invocation remain unchanged.
- License remains CC BY-NC 4.0 and is unchanged.
