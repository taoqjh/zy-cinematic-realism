# Model Capability Matrix

Verified: 2026-09-09 (OpenAI 2.5 refresh; other provider entries retain their 2026-09-03 basis). This is a routing heuristic based on current official product documentation, not a benchmark or permanent ranking. Frontend features may differ from underlying model capabilities.

| Task axis | ChatGPT Images 2.5 / GPT Image 2.5 | Midjourney | Seedream 5.0 Pro | Nano Banana family |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Natural-language instruction following | Strong | Good to Strong with concise, concrete relationships in V8.2 | Strong | Strong |
| Cinematic single-image generation | Strong | Strong | Strong | Strong |
| Stylistic exploration | Good | Strong | Good | Good |
| Multi-reference handling | Strong with explicit roles and user priorities | Strong through V8.2 Edit Model with up to four supplied references | Strong / frontend-dependent | Model-dependent; Strong on current generalist/pro members |
| Character or object continuity | Strong reference-subject preservation with explicit locks; inspect drift | Conditional through Edit Model references plus explicit continuity locks; not seed | Good to Strong with references | Good to Strong; member and workflow dependent |
| Iterative conversational editing | Strong; improved preservation across turns, still inspect each edit | Good to Strong through V8.2 Edit Model; workflow dependent | Strong | Strong |
| Local or region-specific editing | Strong precise editing with explicit change/preserve scope; tool-dependent | Good to Strong through Editor inpainting and V8.2 Edit Model | Strong when spatial controls are exposed | Good to Strong; member and frontend dependent |
| Spatial relationship control | Strong with explicit structured scene relationships | Good when relational clauses survive compression | Strong | Strong |
| Visible text and typography | Good | Conditional; short double-quoted text is preferred | Strong | Good to Strong; member dependent |
| Layout, poster, or graphic design | Good | Good for exploration | Strong | Good to Strong; member dependent |
| Prompt compression sensitivity | Low to moderate | Moderate; concise prompts help, but story/camera/light relations must remain explicit | Moderate | Low to moderate |
| Parameterized control | API/frontend dependent | Strong native parameter workflow | Frontend-dependent | API/frontend dependent |
| Fast exploration | Improved latency; API Flare favors speed | Strong | Good | Strong on speed-oriented members |
| Multi-turn workflow | Strong | Frontend-dependent | Good to Strong | Strong |

## Selection Rules

- Match the recommendation to the user's actual interface, references, editing needs, text needs, and iteration style.
- Give one primary choice and optionally one backup. Do not call any model universally best.
- Treat `Conditional` and `Frontend-dependent` as a prompt to verify the user's tool, not as a deficiency score.
- Do not infer exact reference counts, resolution limits, strength ranges, or parameters from this matrix.

## OpenAI 2.5 routing notes

The current baseline emphasizes natural-language instructions, high-fidelity image inputs, reference-subject preservation, precise edits, and preservation across a multi-turn sequence. It still needs explicit reference roles, spatial relationships, and change/preserve constraints; no exact consistency guarantee follows from a `Strong` rating.

ChatGPT / Codex users receive a visual brief, not an API configuration. For API tasks, Flare favors fast high-quality generation; Sunburst favors editing precision with longer generation time. Test validated GPT Image 2 prompts unchanged first and keep legacy compatibility. See the [OpenAI adapter](models/gpt-image-2.md) for migration, capability changes, and product/API boundaries.

## Midjourney V8.2 routing notes

- V8.2 is the default adapter for unqualified Midjourney or MJ requests; a version flag is optional, not an automatic suffix.
- Image Prompts influence content, composition, and colors; Style References influence aesthetic language rather than identity; Edit Model References carry supplied people, objects, or images into V8.2 editing and recombination.
- V8.2 Edit Model replaces Omni Reference, Character Reference, and the separate Retexture tool as the default current workflow.
- Standard and HD generation are available. Current official limits allow aspect ratios up to 14:1 in SD and 4:1 in HD; a Transcode Lock must not be silently reshaped to fit a mode.
- Personalization and Moodboards are aesthetic controls, not scene, composition, or identity locks. Use only a profile the user supplies or confirms is active.
- Raw, stylize, weird, seed, references, and other parameters are request-driven controls. Do not build a permanent suffix template.
